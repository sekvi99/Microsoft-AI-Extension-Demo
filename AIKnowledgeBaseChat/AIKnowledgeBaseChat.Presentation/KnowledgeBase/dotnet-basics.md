# .NET Basics

## What is .NET?

.NET is a free, open-source developer platform created by Microsoft for building many different types of applications.
With .NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, games, IoT, and
more.

## Key Components

### .NET Runtime

The .NET Runtime includes the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which provides services like memory management, garbage
collection, exception handling, and type safety.

### Base Class Library (BCL)

The BCL provides fundamental types and utility classes that form the foundation of all .NET applications. It includes
collections, file I/O, string manipulation, and networking capabilities.

### SDK and Tools

The .NET SDK includes everything you need to build and run .NET applications, including the runtime, compilers, and
command-line tools.

## Supported Languages

- **C#**: A modern, object-oriented programming language
- **F#**: A functional-first programming language
- **Visual Basic**: An approachable language with simple syntax

## Cross-Platform Support

.NET runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, enabling developers to build once and run anywhere. This is achieved through the
unified .NET platform that merged .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin.

## Application Types

You can build various application types with .NET:

- Web applications (ASP.NET Core)
- Desktop applications (WPF, WinForms, MAUI)
- Mobile applications (.NET MAUI)
- Cloud services and APIs
- Microservices
- Machine learning applications (ML.NET)
- Games (Unity)
